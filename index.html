                <h2>Henri Lebesgue</h2>
                <p>
                    Henri Lebesgue was born on 28 June 1875 in Beauvais, Oise. Lebesgue's father was a typesetter and his mother was a school teacher. His parents assembled at home a library that the young Henri was able to use. His father died of tuberculosis when Lebesgue
                    was still very young and his mother had to support him by herself. As he showed a remarkable talent for mathematics in primary school, one of his instructors arranged for community support to continue his education at the Collège de
                    Beauvais and then at Lycée Saint-Louis and Lycée Louis-le-Grand in Paris.

                <h2>Guido Fubini</h2>
                <p>
                    Born in Venice, he was steered towards mathematics at an early age by his teachers and his father, who was himself a teacher of mathematics. In 1896 he entered the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, where he studied under the notable mathematicians Ulisse
                    Dini and Luigi Bianchi. He gained some early fame when his 1900 doctoral thesis, entitled Clifford's parallelism in elliptic spaces, was discussed in a widely read work on differential geometry published by Bianchi in 1902.

                <h2>Aryabhata</h2>
                <p>
                    Aryabhata mentions in the Aryabhatiya that he was 23 years old 3,600 years into the Kali Yuga,mentioned year corresponds to 499 CE, and implies that he was born in 476.Aryabhata is the author of several treatises on mathematics and astronomy, some of which are lost.
                    His major work, Aryabhatiya, a compendium of mathematics and astronomy, was extensively referred to in the Indian mathematical literature and has survived to modern times.Aryabhata worked on the approximation for pi (π),Place value system and zero,Trigonometry,Algebra and more.
